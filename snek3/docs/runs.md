# Runs — current state and forward plan

**Phases 0-4 are closed and batch b1 has run.** `env/`, `vectorized/`, the measurement engine,
checkpoint I/O, the eval wave, the charts, the viewers, `dqn/`, `train.py` and the desktop daemon are
all in, and the box runs snek3 rather than snek2. **The phase-3 gate is still open** — see Now.

**Phase 0 — the two env implementations agree.** 36,000 states × 30 observation indices, **0
mismatches**, across a growth regime (24,000 states, 49 episodes, lengths to 60) and a coiled endgame
regime (12,000 states, 280 episodes, 26 perfect games), with rewards, terminations, both shaping
terms and the win path in parity too. **17 of 17 hand-made mutants killed.**

**Phase 1 — the snek2 champion plays in torch.** `b44a-lowlr7-b29b-ckpt2739000` converted and
measured **98.8% perfect over 3,000 episodes** against snek2's 98.73%, inside the ±0.6 pp gate. The
conversion itself is exact rather than close: on 12,864 states the two networks' Q-values differ by
at most 2.7e-5 on values of magnitude ~30.6, and the **argmax is identical on every state**, so the
policies are the same function. `watch.py` plays it and `record_gif.py` records it.

**Phase 2 — the flat protocol reproduces the tiered one.** All **3,222** checkpoints of
`b45a-lowlr8-b29b` converted and measured, against snek2's own close-out: mean per-row difference
**−0.004 pp** on a 0.041 pp standard error, and observed spread / predicted spread **1.00**. 14
minutes on four shards. Three findings came out of it, including a **5.7x correction to the cost of
stage A** — see [`findings.md`](findings.md).

## Now

**Batch b2 — b29's record config on the torch stack, seeds 1-4, 3M steps.** All four on the desktop,
launched 2026-08-29 08:09. This is the phase-3 gate re-run on the configuration snek2 actually set
records with; b1 ran snek3's bare defaults and that was the wrong batch to gate on.

| knob | snek3 default | b2 = b29 |
|---|---|---|
| `SNEK_IS_WEIGHTS` | 1 | **0** |
| `SNEK_TARGET_UPDATE_PERIOD` | 8 | **1000** |
| `SNEK_DISCOUNT` | 0.99 | **0.9975** |
| `SNEK_FOOD_DISTANCE_REWARD` | 0.001 | **0** |
| `SNEK_CHASE_SAFE_SHAPING` | 0.0 | **0.1** |
| `SNEK_CHASE_SAFE_GATE` | 85 | **75** |
| `SNEK_FC_LAYERS` | 320 | 320 |

**Five knobs differ, not the two b1's write-up first suggested.** The target-update period and the
discount are substantial algorithmic differences, and they were nearly missed by reading the results
summary instead of snek2's own b47 spec. Read the spec.

Seed N is pinned to arm letter N, so every arm is seed-matched against b29a-d, b41a-d, b47a-d **and**
snek3's own b1a-d. Budget ~7 h an arm; the desktop auto-queues one stage-B wave for the batch.

**b1 is closed** ([`results.md`](results.md)): four arms at 3M, peak perfect 42.1 / 58.3 / 56.7 /
81.9%, **no checkpoint anywhere at 95/100**, every arm still climbing at its cap. Its stage-B wave
has run and published 0 rows an arm, which is the honest measurement rather than a failure.

## Next, in order

1. **Read b2 against b1 and against b29/b41/b47.** A b2-vs-b29 difference smaller than the
   b29-vs-b41 process-noise gap is noise, not a port regression — snek2 ran that config three times
   precisely to have the yardstick.
2. **Phase 6 — `ppo/`.** The reason snek3 exists.

**Decide the stage-A batching question before phase 6, not after.** Stage A at 16.9 ep/s is ~90% of
an arm's wall clock and the 5.7x is recoverable, but every way of recovering it makes the epsilon
schedule's feedback lag ([`invariants.md`](invariants.md) invariant 2). b1 is the baseline any such
change is measured against, and a 6M-step arm makes the cost twice as visible.

## Backlog

One line per idea, with a prior. A design that is settled enough to implement gets a file in
[`../plans/`](../plans/) and a row here.

| idea | prior |
|---|---|
| **PPO** | the reason snek3 exists. On-policy and wide, so it is the algorithm that actually exploits a 196k env-steps/s vectorised env, where DQN's replay ratio caps the loop at ~4,000 steps/s |
| **Batched or asynchronous self-eval** | **worth 5.7x on an arm, and measured, not projected.** ~5 h an arm becomes ~1 h. The win is keeping the lanes full rather than overlapping with training, so batching K checkpoints into one `measure_stream` call gets nearly all of it. Cost either way is a K-interval lag on the epsilon schedule, which is a feedback loop rather than a readout — pre-register it |
| **Replay ratio < 1** | the only way past ~4,000 agent steps/s for DQN, and a learning-dynamics change rather than a free win. Pre-register it |
| **Drop observation indices 10/12/14** | ~1.5x on the observation build. Region enumeration is 33% of the connectivity cost and those three indices are its only consumers. Batch 45 reached 99% with them in, so this is a cost question |
| **Munchausen-DQN, SAC-discrete** | the discrete off-policy actor-critic options, if PPO underperforms. **TD3 does not apply** — it is continuous-action and this task has three discrete actions |
